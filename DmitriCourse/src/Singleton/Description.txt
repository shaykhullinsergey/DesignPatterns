Singleton
-A component which is instantiated only once

-For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system
	-Database repository
	-Object factory
-Constructor call is expensive
	-We only do it once
	-We provide everyone with the same instance
-Want to prevent anyone creating additional copies
-Need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety

-Making a 'safe' singleton is easy: construct a static Lazy<T> and return its Value
-Singletons are difficult to test
-Instead of directly using a singleton, consider depending on an abstraction
-Consider defining singleton lifetime in DI container
