Builder
-When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly

-Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call
-Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create
-Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive
-Instead, opt for piecewise construction
-Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

-A builder is a separate component for building an object
-Can either give builder a constructor or return it via a static function
-To make a builder fluent
-Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class
