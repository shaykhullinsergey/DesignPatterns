Bridge
-A mechanism that decouples an interface from an implementation

-Bridge prevents a 'Cartesian product' complexity explosion
-Example
	-Base class ThreadScheduler
	-Can be preemptive or cooperative
	-Can run on Windows or Unix
	-End up with a 2x2 scenario:
		-WindowsPTS
		-UnixPTS
		-WindowsCTS
		-UnixCTS
-Bridge patter avoids the entity explosion

-Decouple abstraction from implementation
-Both can exist as hierarchies
-A stronger form of encapsulation
