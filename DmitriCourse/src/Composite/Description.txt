Composite
-A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner

-Objects use other fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition
-Composition lets us make compound objects
	-Mathematical expression composed of simple expressions
	-A grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes
-Composite design pattern is used to treat both single(scalar) and composite objects uniformly
	-Foo and Collection<Foo> have common API

-Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition
-Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviours
-Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects unfortunately
-C# has special support for the enumaration concept
-A single object can maswuerade as a collection with yield return this;
