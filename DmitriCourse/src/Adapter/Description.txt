Adapter
-A construct which adapts an existsng interface X to conform to the required interface Y

-We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
-We use a special device (adapter) to give us the interface we require from the interface we have

-Determine the API you have and the API you need
-Create a component which aggregates the adaptee
-Intermediate representations can pile up: use caching and other optimisations
